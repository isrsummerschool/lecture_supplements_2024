Volumetric Radar Example
For the case of a scattering from a volume like we have in incoherent scatter, we write the radar equation differently. This is because we are scattering off individual electrons that are uniformly distributed across the entire volume within a range gate. As shown in slide 17 in the second set of introduction to radar, we can define this scattering volume as:  𝛼𝑅2Δ𝑅 .

𝛼  is the entire angle within the main lobes of the gain pattern,  𝐺 ,  ≈4𝜋𝐴/𝜆2≈4𝜋/𝛼 . Gain simply represents the fraction of energy that instead of being scattered uniformly in all directions, is being scattered within the one main beam  ≈𝛼 . It is important to note that the entire volume within the range gate is doing the scattering. The delta range corresponds to the range gate that is being analyzed.

The radar equation for volumetric scattering changes to:

𝑃𝑟=𝑃𝑡𝐴𝜎𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒Δ𝑅4𝜋𝑅2
 
Note: that this equation on has an  𝑅−2  versus an  𝑅−4 . The volume scattering cross section has area per volume units (m 2 /m 3  or 1/m) - in this case it rep#resents the entire number of electrons within a volume - since they all are contrbuting.
